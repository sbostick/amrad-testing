The online HAM testing site I used:
* https://parcradio.org/

Great site for practice, reading the questions and answers:
* https://hamexam.org/view_pool/18-Technician

Another excellent source providing questions/answers/explanations:
* https://hamstudy.org/ (croud sourced explanations?)

Good reading material:
* https://www.hamradioschool.com/technician-learning

Ham Radio Prep is where I started and found it very useful. The instructional
format for each section is video, followed by self-reading the same content and
studying diagrams, and finally a practice test. I augmented the material with
online resources, reading from ARRL books, and watching lots of YouTube videos.

The ARRL provides online practice tests also although I prefer hamexam.org
for stats tracking and the weighted selection of questions. And I prefer
hamstudy.org for the answer descriptions so I can understand the reasoning
and methodology behind the answers.
